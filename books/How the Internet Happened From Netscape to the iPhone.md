# How the Internet Happened From Netscape to the iPhone

- Almost from the very beginning, Andreessen and Clark wanted their web browser to enable an ecosystem that other programs, and even other companies, could be built off of.
- If you are a platform, you can create an ecosystem of developers and software and apps all dependent on the underlying platform. To own a platform is to own the ball field, the rule book, the turnstiles, and the broadcast rights.
- The traditional rule of thumb was that a company didn’t go public until it had three years of solid revenue growth;
- Software is a high-margin business; a hit software product can be a gold mine, and investors were eager for a new breed of startups.
- Netscape was not the first company to go public without significant profits (or even revenue) to speak of. Speculative enterprises like mining, energy and pharmaceutical companies often IPO early in order to raise money on the promise of a big score sometime in the future.
- The information superhighway was the fever dream of the telephone industry and the cable industry and the computer industry and even of Hollywood. The idea was that we’d all be linked together via a Frankenstein-like combination of the television and the PC. We’d be able to shop from home, and exchange video chats with each other, and rent movies on demand and receive personalized news and media based on our interests. I know. Sounds exactly like the Internet we know today. But all of this was supposed to happen on your television.
- They did so in, probably, the only way that change can be made in large corporate environments: via the quiet, measured insurrection of memorandums.
- Irony of ironies, the code that would be the basis for Microsoft’s web browser (and the weapon Microsoft would soon wield against Netscape) was a descendant of the same code written by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina a few years before at the NCSA.
- It turned out that when people went online what they really wanted to do was interact with each other.
- Paraphrasing the famous New Yorker cartoon (“On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog”), in AOL chat rooms, nobody knew if you were a twenty-two-year-old blonde with a pinup’s body or a fifty-five-year-old divorced guy with a beer belly.
- “the next big thing always starts out dismissed as a ‘toy.’
- It’s conceptually jarring to realize that a medium and an industry that we think of as being so futuristic and technological is sustained by a business model that is centuries old.
- “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.”
- in ways complex and yet not entirely appreciated, our online activities have delivered the holy grail of advertising from time immemorial: knowing exactly an audience’s interests so that the ad man can market only to the most promising leads.
- necessity dictated that search engines would become the most popular and most important early websites.
- When a user searches a search engine, they’re not actually searching the web itself, but are instead querying the database of copied webpages the search engine has compiled. The accuracy and comprehensiveness of this database varied from search engine to search engine and the results therefore varied depending on the weight each search engine gave to various factors in the database.
- If Netscape’s business seemed intangible, Yahoo’s seemed downright hypothetical.
- It would become an article of faith during the dot-com era that being early to market on the Internet frontier conferred a magical “first-mover advantage” on whomever was so fortunate.
- Even when competing services showed up, users had a tendency to stick with what they knew, so long as it continued to work.
- the longest-lasting legacy of Netscape Navigator setting the standard for the early web is that, to this day, SSL, via its descendant, TLS, enables the vast majority of online
- the longest-lasting legacy of Netscape Navigator setting the standard for the early web is that, to this day, SSL, via its descendant, TLS, enables the vast majority of online commercial transactions worldwide.
- In a perfect marketplace, the market price is the correct price because buyers and sellers (ideally, multiple buyers and sellers) can haggle to arrive at an optimal result.
- lot of AuctionWeb’s early user growth came from things like antiques and collectibles because, unwittingly, Omidyar was tapping into something the Internet had been very good at from its inception: providing a platform for niche interests.

- eBay would be one of the first web companies to understand that all the value of its service came from the users and their community.
- eBay allowed a person to sell to the entire world from their tiny little corner of it.
- In June 1997, Benchmark Capital paid $5 million for 21.5% of eBay. By various measures, this deal would go down in history as one of the greatest investment home runs of all time. Benchmark’s stake in eBay would eventually be worth $4 billion.
- there were some types of content that audiences were willing to pay for.
- Today, we take for granted that social-networking sites like Facebook are merely platforms for user activity.
- Today, we take for granted that social-networking sites like Facebook are merely platforms for user activity. Facebook doesn’t actually generate anything itself. We do. The users generate content for Facebook to advertise against. The early social sites stumbled upon this miraculous business model almost a decade before Mark Zuckerberg did.
- because people were tied to their computers at work, there was a certain “prime time” for content during the day.
- This kind of practice is now called viral marketing, the technique of promotion by rabid user word of mouth.
- Sure, the portals claimed that all of this was in the interest of providing useful info like local weather conditions, personalized headlines and stock quotes. But the reality, of course, was that they now had the holy grail of marketing: demographic data to target ads against. This served to turbo-boost the advertising revenues the search sites were already generating.

- But the fact is, the dot-com bubble was a truly singular event, brought on by a unique mixture of causes, and we are unlikely to see its kind again in our lifetimes.
- If history tells us anything, it’s that when people come to believe only good news can ever happen, a speculative financial bubble is probably inevitable.
- Hedge fund managers, mutual fund managers, stock analysts, even financial reporters learned and internalized a sharp lesson in the late nineties: People didn’t want to hear negativity.
- “You wouldn’t get ‘hype’ working if there weren’t something fundamentally, potentially sound under it.”
- Spending, spending, spending became a vicious cycle that artificially turbocharged everything in the dot-com era.
- Plenty of dot-com startups were founded around concepts that were quite possibly good ideas but were just a bit too early for the time.
- Was there any one thing that pricked the dot-com bubble? Of course not. There were a myriad of factors that all accumulated to bring about the end of irrational exuberance.
- What we can say definitively is that we know who ended up holding the bag as the bubble exploded: average investors.
- Everyday Americans were the most aggressive investors in the dot-com bubble68 at the very moment the bubble was at its height—and right at the moment the smart money was getting out.
- Railways were cutting-edge in the 1840s. As with the dot-coms, there was a period of about three or four years when Britons experienced a mad rush to invest in business schemes surrounding this new technology.
- The mileage of rail schemes authorized during the bubble years came to represent 90% of the total route mileage on Britain’s rail system.
- there was a degree of frisson
- fundamental truth about the web that is glaringly obvious when you state it out loud: it is built on links. One page linking to another; one idea linking to another.

- PageRank wasn’t finding new things. It was merely finding things in a better way. The earlier search engines were already answering every query correctly. But it was finding the needle in the haystack and putting it at the top of the list that PageRank did better.
- a lot of it was Page and Brin’s ingrained Montessori philosophy: they never met a problem they couldn’t solve through smart engineering.

- by virtue of being flush with cash when the rest of Silicon Valley was seemingly going belly-up, Google was able to have its pick of talent when the dot-com layoffs began.
- It turned out that Napster’s biggest problem was what it actually did: allow users to exchange copyrighted songs for free. It allowed people to pirate music.

- The phenomenon of Napster, this seemingly organic impulse that suddenly inspired millions of everyday people to skirt copyright laws and social conventions and begin exchanging music freely with one another—it was largely inspired by the publicity surrounding Napster’s legal battles.
- the music industry was caught in a classic innovator’s dilemma, tied to a highly lucrative business model it was loath to give up, even in the face of an existential threat presented by new technology.
- Making it dead simple for people to get what they wanted would make piracy seem like a hassle in comparison.
- the iPod was the first device to prove that computers were no longer just computers.
- Apple showed a willingness to eat its young in order to stay on the cutting edge; to out-innovate itself before others ever had the chance.
- The lesson of commerce in the Internet Era—from Amazon through Napster through the iTunes store—has been that consumer habits and expectations have changed radically. The general public has intuited that the Internet and digital technology enable a world of unlimited selection and instant gratification.
- Netflix invested heavily in this technology, hiring mathematicians and computer scientists to tweak the algorithm to include recommendations based on the habits of subscribers with similar taste.
- Store closings, layoffs and bankruptcies are often the markers we use to measure the disruptive effects of ecommerce.
- An important component of this entire process was the ability to “pay per click” —as opposed to paying based on the number of people who (theoretically) viewed your ad, as every other online advertiser did in the dot-com era.
- Google did this because, almost counterintuitively, it knew that it stood to make more money when the ads were ranked this way. Over time, more money would come in from a 5-cent ad that was clicked on twenty-five times—than from a dollar ad that was only clicked on once.
- A win-win innovation for Google and its search users.
- In retrospect, going into advertising played into Google’s deepest strengths. For a company full of data-obsessed nerds, Google looked at advertising as just another problem smart algorithms could solve.
- Napster was the first time mainstream web users saw the utility in producing, not just consuming, content.
- The idea of collaborative effort and collective organization had long been a common practice in hacker and software development circles.
- Far from being a case of “too many cooks in the kitchen” creating a muddled fiasco, open-source development proved that complete strangers could independently, and without much centralized coordination, come together to collectively produce things in an orderly, sublime way.
- Cunningham is famous for coining “Cunningham’s Law,” which finds that “the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it’s to post the wrong answer.”
- If Web 1.0 was about browsing stuff created by others, Web 2.0 was about creating stuff yourself.
- If Web 1.0 was about browsing stuff created by others, Web 2.0 was about creating stuff yourself. If Web 1.0 was about connecting all the computers in the world together, then Web 2.0 was about connecting all the people in the world together, via those interlaced computers.
- The social graph was actually the great prize of Web 2.0. Others were only able to seize this prize because AOL dropped the ball.
- Gates didn’t start out to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time. He grew into the role. It was only after he had one of the great business insights of all time—that software was the truly valuable nexus point of technology—that he seized his destiny

- From the beginning of the web, all the way through the launch of Google AdWords, the Internet had been monetized on the premise of taking the guesswork out of advertising. Well, on Facebook people were using their real names. They were volunteering their likes and dislikes. You could actually get people to tell you if they were interested in your product or not. It was advertising’s holy grail.
- none of that would have been possible had Zuckerberg not matured into the sort of businessman who could make such a gamble. The fact that he did is the entrepreneurial story of our age.

- BlackBerry users were the first people to confront the social etiquette implications of conversations and person-to-person interactions being interrupted by digital notifications.
- Social networks succeeded in making the Internet truly a personal experience. Smartphones, combined with social networks, took personal computing and made it almost intimate computing. Where would social media be without mobile computing, without smartphones: the perfect tools, always on hand to record and organize the ephemera of our daily lives? Would Facebook be at a billion users today if smartphones, in the example of iPhone, hadn’t presented the perfect vehicle for social media consumption and production? And if not for the iPhone kick-starting the smartphone revolution, whither Snapchat? Or Twitter? Much less, Uber?
- There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association.
- Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking
- Legend holds that the founder of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, once remarked, “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” This quote is probably apocryphal, but it does capture the early thinking when computers first began to serve man.
