# Things Fall Apart A Novel
- He had no patience with unsuccessful men. He had had no patience with his father.
- Among the Ibo the art of conversation is regarded very highly, and proverbs are the palm-oil with which words are eaten.
- Age was respected among his people, but achievement was revered.
- Age was respected among his people, but achievement was revered. As the elders said, if a child washed his hands he could eat with kings. Okonkwo had clearly washed his hands and so he ate with kings and elders.
- Perhaps down in his heart Okonkwo was not a cruel man. But his whole life was dominated by fear, the fear of failure and of weakness. It was deeper and more intimate than the fear of evil and capricious gods and of magic, the fear of the forest, and of the forces of nature, malevolent, red in tooth and claw.
- And so Okonkwo was ruled by one passionâ€”to hate everything that his father Unoka had loved. One of those things was gentleness and another was idleness.
