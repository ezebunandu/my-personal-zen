# The Intelligence Trap Why Smart People Make Dumb Mistakes
- Binet himself was under no illusions that his test captured the full breadth of “intelligence”; he believed our “mental worth” was simply too amorphous to be measured on a single scale and he balked at the idea that a low score should come to define a child’s future opportunities, believing that it could be malleable across the lifetime.
- Even if you are skeptical of the IQ test, many people still believe that those abstract reasoning skills, so crucial for academic success, represent an underlying intelligence that automatically translates to better judgment and decision making across life—at work, at home, in finance, or in politics.
- For any career, there are plenty of people of lower IQ who outperform those with much higher scores, and people with greater intelligence who don’t make the most of their brainpower,
- general intelligence depends on the way our genes interact with the culture around us.
